# Progress

## What Works:
- The project structure is set up for a Python-based TTS proxy.
- Basic file organization for API key management, configuration, and voice management is in place.
- Caching mechanism for audio files is indicated by the `cache` directory.
- The `README.md` provides a good overview of features and architecture, though it is outdated regarding the main script.
- `tts_gui.py` is confirmed as the main GUI entry point, utilizing PyQt5.
- Core logic is modularized within `tts_modules`.
- Detailed analysis of `tts_modules/processor.py` completed and saved to `memory-bank/analysis/tts_modules_processor.md`.
- Detailed analysis of `tts_modules/config.py` completed and saved to `memory-bank/analysis/tts_modules_config.md`.
- Detailed analysis of `tts_modules/api_key_manager.py` completed and saved to `memory-bank/analysis/tts_modules_api_key_manager.md`.
- Detailed analysis of `tts_modules/voice_manager.py` completed and saved to `memory-bank/analysis/tts_modules_voice_manager.md`.
- Detailed analysis of `tts_modules/proxy_manager.py` completed and saved to `memory-bank/analysis/tts_modules_proxy_manager.md`.
- Detailed analysis of `tts_modules/cli.py` completed and saved to `memory-bank/analysis/tts_modules_cli.md`.
- Detailed analysis of `tts_gui.py` completed and saved to `memory-bank/analysis/tts_gui.md`.
- Detailed analysis of `BASE.csv` completed and saved to `memory-bank/analysis/BASE_csv.md`.
- Detailed analysis of `Base.xlsx` completed and saved to `memory-bank/analysis/Base_xlsx.md`.
- Detailed analysis of `api_keys.csv` completed and saved to `memory-bank/analysis/api_keys_csv.md`.
- All analysis files in `memory-bank/analysis/` have been successfully re-created.

## What's Left to Build/Understand:
- **Error Handling:** How the system handles API errors, network issues, or invalid inputs. (General overview, not specific file analysis)
- **Testing:** Are there any existing tests or a testing strategy?
- **Deployment:** How is this system intended to be deployed or run in a production environment?

## Current Status:
- Memory bank initialization is complete and updated with confirmed architectural details.
- Initial hypotheses about project components and their roles have been formed, refined, and largely validated.
- Key files for deeper analysis have been identified and prioritized.
- All requested detailed analysis files for scripts/classes and data files have been generated and saved.

## Known Issues:
- The `README.md` is outdated regarding the main script; `VOICE_Proxy.py` and `Voice.py` are obsolete.
- Security concern: API keys and proxy credentials are stored in plain text in `BASE.csv`.
- Code duplication exists between `tts_modules/processor.py` and `tts_modules/cli.py` for utility functions and the `main` entry point.
- `api_keys.csv` appears to be an unused or obsolete file.

## Evolution of Project Decisions:
- The project has evolved from a single script (`VOICE_Proxy.py`) to a more modular structure with dedicated GUI and CLI entry points and core logic separated into `tts_modules`.
- The decision to use a modular Python structure is evident.
- The use of CSV/Excel for configuration/data suggests a simpler, file-based approach rather than a database.
- The caching mechanism is a clear design choice for performance optimization.
