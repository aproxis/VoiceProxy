# Project Brief

## Project Name: VoiceProxy

## Overview:
The `VoiceProxy` module is a Python-based text-to-speech automation tool that uses the ElevenLabs API to generate voiceovers from Excel-stored text. It manages API keys, proxy routing, voice selection, and sequential audio file generation.

## Initial Goals:
1. Understand the core functionality of the VoiceProxy system.
2. Identify key components and their interactions.
3. Document the project structure and dependencies.
4. Prepare the memory bank for ongoing project documentation.

## Current Status:
- Initial project exploration completed using `README.md`.
- Memory bank structure is being initialized and updated with detailed information.

## Next Steps:
- Clarify the role of `VOICE_Proxy.py` and `Voice.py` with the user, as `README.md` indicates `VOICE_Proxy.py` is the main script, contradicting previous information.
- Continue populating memory bank files with validated information.
- Begin reading key project files to gather more detailed information, focusing on `VOICE_Proxy.py` (pending clarification), `tts_gui.py`, and files within `tts_modules`.
